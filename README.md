## Hello!

The PRTrackerApp folder holds the MainWindow.xaml and MainWindow.xaml.cs files from visual code which hold the essential bits as well as some other regulatory files.
In the main repo, the prtable.sql file holds the dump displaying how i set up the database on mysql. In additon the main.py holds the code for a PyQt5 desktop app
that is somewhat adjacent to wpf.
